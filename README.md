# Welcom to crypto-ratings
A rating / insurance platform of the crypto world

## Intention

Crypto market is a wild west, and it is basically like that fundamentally. Cryptos born with the intention to be decentralized, and because it's decentralized it's virtually impossible to be regulated by a centralized institution.

From the past centuries we have experience a cycle on the markets where :

1. It starts with no regulation, winning and loses are made
2. Major loses happen, people call for regulations
3. A centralized institution comes with a "solution" and that market is regulated


Like it or not, the regulations all came into force, and we can argue if the regulations made by centralized institutions really helps or not, but they exists nonetheless.

And we can all agree that regulations always come to a unregulated market. With cryptos is a bit different for some , again, fundamental reasons:

1. It's run entirely on the internet.
2. It's decentralized.
3. It's mostly encrypted.

Those 3 reasons makes any crypto coin, defi, dao's virtually impossible to be regulated, because those assets / company's can be created anywhere in the world, far from a country's regulations.

Although, there are some sort of regulations centralized institutions can do, but it's mostly related to attack users than the services provided withing the crypto market, and only able to seek legal action if some of those coins, defi's and dao's are located withing the centralized institution reach. Hence it's virtual impossible regulation.

But regulating a decentralized market can be achieved naturally, and when big money comes to play, there are a need to a market to becomes more controlled ... at least the mainstream part of it, so how come we can regulate it ?

## Proposal

### Introducing Crypto Ratings

A Risk Evaluation in Decentralized Risk Management.

Throughout years, financial institutions were looking on how they can trust borrow money to other institutions and understand the risks of not getting their money back. So some of then started to create rating grades , creating a risk assessment of those who seeks investment, from companies to countries. Today , when a country want's to issue a debt , investors looks at S&P, Moody's, Fitch, DBRS risk ratings to understand how risky it is to borrow money to that country and get their money back ... with interests, and riskier the country, more riskier is to get you money back.

And that's what I came to you to propose one of the solutions to regulate crypto market: Educate on how risky it is to put your money on cryptos.

Today on decentralized market , we don't have those risk assessment yet, and you learn about scamming coins, defi's and dao's only by experience and learning , but some people learn that too late, when they already lost loads of money and put their life at risk. So I want to provide a platform where a Asset/Institution can be scanned, rated and this rate maintained by the community.

And for that we have to understand how we can issue a risk assessment of a crypto asset/institution.

### Definitions

The terms below are defined for use in this paper standard of practice.

- **Economic Capital**: The amount of capital an DOrg requires to survive or to meet
a business objective for a specified period of time and risk metric, given its risk profile.

- **Emerging Risk** : New or evolving risks that may be difficult to manage since their
likelihood, impact, timing or interdependency with other risks are highly uncertain.

- **Decentralized Risk Management** : The discipline by which an DOrg assesses, controls, exploits, finances and monitors risks from all sources for the purpose
of increasing the organization’s/cryptos short- and long-term value to its stakeholders.

- **Decentralized Risk Management Control Cycle** : The continuing process by which risks are
identified, risks are evaluated, risk appetites are chosen, risk limits are set, risks are
accepted or avoided, risk mitigation activities are performed, and actions are taken when
risk limits are breached.

- **DOrg** : The entity for which DRM is being performed. Examples include crypto assets, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations.

- **Risk** : The potential of future losses or shortfalls from expectations due to deviation of
actual results from expected results.

- **Risk Appetite** : The level of aggregate risk that an DOrg chooses to take in pursuit
of its objectives.

- **Risk Evaluation System** : A combination of practices, tools, and methodologies within a
risk management system used to measure the potential impacts of risk events on the
performance metrics of an DOrg.

- **Risk Limit** : A threshold used to monitor the actual risk exposure of a specific unit or
units of the DOrg to ensure that the level of aggregate risk remains within the risk
tolerance.

- **Risk Management System** : A combination of practices, tools and methodologies that an
DOrg uses to identify, assess, measure, mitigate, and manage the risks it faces
during the course of conducting its business.

- **Risk Metric** : A measure of risk. Examples include value at risk, expected policyholders
deficit, and conditional tail expectation.

- **Risk Mitigation** : Action that reduces the frequency or severity of a risk.

- **Risk Profile** :The risks to which an DOrg is exposed over a specified period of
time.

- **Risk Tolerance** : The aggregate risk-taking capacity of an DOrg.

- **Scenario Test** : A process for assessing the impact of one possible event or several
simultaneously or sequentially occurring possible events on an DOrg financial
position.

- **Stress Test** : A process for measuring the impact of adverse changes in one or relatively
few factors affecting an DOrg financial position.


### Risk Evaluation

How we going to evaluate a risk in many contexts, using various tools such as economic capital models and stress and scenario tests. In
performing services related to risk evaluation, the actuary should consider, or may rely on others who have considered, the following:

Information about the financial strength, risk profile, and risk environment of the
organization that is appropriate to the assignment. Such information may include
the following:

1. the financial flexibility of the organization;
2. the nature, scale, and complexity of the risks faced by the organization;
3. the potential differences between the current and long-term risk
environments;
4. the organization’s strategic goals, including goals for the level and
 volatility of profits, both short term and long term;
5. the interests, including the risk/reward expectations, of relevant
 stakeholders. These stakeholders may include some or all of the following:
 owners, boards of directors, management, customers, partners,
 employees, regulators and others potentially impacted by the
 organization’s management of risk;
6. regulatory or rating agency criteria for risk levels and the implications of
 potential risk levels on the continuation of business operations as reflected
 in ratings or other external measures of security;
7. the degree to which the organization’s different risks interact with one
 another; actual and perceived diversification benefits; and dependencies or
 correlations of the different risks;
8. limitations to the fungibility of capital across the organization; and
9. the extent to which the organization’s exposure to risks may differ from
 the exposures of its competitors.
