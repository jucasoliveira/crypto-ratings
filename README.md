# Welcome to crypto-ratings

A rating / insurance platform of the crypto world

## Intention

The crypto market is a wild west. And this market was born with the intention of being decentralized and, being decentralized, it is practically impossible to be regulated by a centralized institution.

In recent centuries, we have experienced a cycle in markets where:

1. The market emerges without regulation, gains and losses happen.
2. Massive losses happen, people ask for regulation
3. A centralized institution comes with a "solution" and that market is regulated


Like it or not, every market ends up being regulated in one way or another. We can discuss whether regulations made by centralized institutions really have a positive effect or not, but these regulations exist anyway.

But the market for cryptocurrencies and financing/decentralized organizations is a little different for a few fundamental reasons:

1. It is fully combined on the Internet.
2. It is decentralized.
3. It is mostly encrypted.

These 3 reasons make any cryptocurrency, defi, dao virtually impossible to be regulated, because these assets/companies can be created anywhere in the world, far from the regulations of one country.

Although there is some kind of regulation that centralized institutions can do, these will be mainly focused on users of services provided with the crypto market, and they will only manage to force a lawsuit against decentralized institutions if some of these currencies, defi's and dao's meet within the reach of their jurisdiction. So its virtual impossible.

But regulating a decentralized market can be achieved naturally. When institutions go after more money to finance their operations, financial institutions will require the market to become more controlled... at least the main part of it, so how can we regulate it?
## Proposal

### Introducing Crypto Ratings

A Risk Evaluation in Decentralized Risk Management.

Throughout the years, financial institutions were looking at how they can trust borrow money from other institutions and understand the risks of not getting their money back. So some of them started to create rating grades, creating a risk assessment of those who seek investment, from companies to countries. Today, when a country want's to issue debt, investors look at S&P, Moody's, Fitch, DBRS risk ratings to understand how risky it is to borrow money from that country and get their money back ... with interests, and riskier the country, riskier is to get you money back.

And that's what I came to you to propose one of the solutions to regulate the crypto market: Educate on how risky it is to put your money on cryptos.

Today on decentralized market, we don't have those risk assessments yet, and you learn about scamming coins, defi's, and dao's only by experience and learning, but some people learn that too late when they already lost loads of money and put their life at risk. So I want to provide a platform where an Asset/Institution can be scanned, rated and this rate maintained by the community.

And for that, we have to understand how we can issue a risk assessment of a crypto asset/institution.

### Definitions

The terms below are defined for use in this paper standard of practice.

- **Whale**: A cryptocurrency wallet which hold's large amount of assets based on BTC comparison;
- **Wallet**: A crypto hash which holds assets such as crypto coins, NFT's , etc;
- **Economic Capital**: The amount of capital an DOrg requires to survive or to meet
a business objective for a specified period of time and risk metric, given its risk profile.

- **Emerging Risk** : New or evolving risks that may be difficult to manage since their
likelihood, impact, timing or interdependency with other risks are highly uncertain.

- **Decentralized Risk Management** : The discipline by which an DOrg assesses, controls, exploits, finances and monitors risks from all sources for the purpose
of increasing the organizationâ€™s/cryptos short- and long-term value to its stakeholders.

- **Decentralized Risk Management Control Cycle** : The continuing process by which risks are
identified, risks are evaluated, risk appetites are chosen, risk limits are set, risks are
accepted or avoided, risk mitigation activities are performed, and actions are taken when
risk limits are breached.

- **DOrg** : The entity for which DRM is being performed. Examples include crypto assets, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations.

- **Risk** : The potential of future losses or shortfalls from expectations due to deviation of
actual results from expected results.

- **Risk Appetite** : The level of aggregate risk that an DOrg chooses to take in pursuit
of its objectives.

- **Risk Evaluation System** : A combination of practices, tools, and methodologies within a
risk management system used to measure the potential impacts of risk events on the
performance metrics of an DOrg.

- **Risk Limit** : A threshold used to monitor the actual risk exposure of a specific unit or
units of the DOrg to ensure that the level of aggregate risk remains within the risk
tolerance.

- **Risk Management System** : A combination of practices, tools and methodologies that an
DOrg uses to identify, assess, measure, mitigate, and manage the risks it faces
during the course of conducting its business.

- **Risk Metric** : A measure of risk. Examples include value at risk, expected policyholders
deficit, and conditional tail expectation.

- **Risk Mitigation** : Action that reduces the frequency or severity of a risk.

- **Risk Profile** :The risks to which an DOrg is exposed over a specified period of
time.

- **Risk Tolerance** : The aggregate risk-taking capacity of an DOrg.

- **Scenario Test** : A process for assessing the impact of one possible event or several
simultaneously or sequentially occurring possible events on an DOrg financial
position.

- **Stress Test** : A process for measuring the impact of adverse changes in one or relatively
few factors affecting an DOrg financial position.


### Risk Evaluation

How we going to evaluate a risk in many contexts, using various tools such as economic capital models and stress and scenario tests? In
performing services related to risk evaluation, we should consider, or may rely on others who have considered, the following:

Information about the financial strength, risk profile, and risk environment of the
organization that is appropriate to the assignment. Such information may include
the following:

If it is a crypto coin:

1. The number of whales holding the wallet;
2. The contract limits of transaction and or a risk management system, a.k.a anti bot;
3. the potential differences between the volatility of the coin price both in short term and long-term ;
4. the interests, including the risk/reward expectations, of relevant
 stakeholders on liquidity pools. These stakeholders may include some or all of the following:
 owners wallets, whales wallets and others potentially impacted by the
 DOgs management of risk;
5. external ratings criteria for risk levels and the implications of
 potential risk levels on the continuation of the coin exchange as reflected
 in ratings or other external measures of security;
6. the degree to which the origins wallets interact withing other risk managed DOg's and whales;
7. limitations to the coin's liquidation returns to stakeholders; and
8. the extent to which the DOg's exposure to risks may differ from
 the exposures of its competitors.

 If it is a Defi:
 


If it is a DAO:





### Risk Grading

Risk grading is the calculation of the  Average Probability of DOg Default / price goes to 0:

- **AAA+**: 0.03%
- **AAA**: 0.05%
- **AA+**: 0.06%
- **AA**: 0.07%
- **A+**: 0.08%
- **A**: 0.09%
- **BBB+**: 0.10%
- **BBB**: 0.25%
- **BB+**: 0.50%
- **BB**: 1.00%
- **B+**: 2.50%
- **B**: 8.00%
- **CCC+**: 12.00%
- **CCC**: 22.00%
- **CC+**: 30.00%
- **CC**: 38.00%
- **C+**: 42.00%
- **C**: 50.00%
- **DDD+**: 58.00%
- **DDD**: 66.00%
- **DD+**: 74.00%
- **DD**: 82.00%
